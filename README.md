# Conway's Game of Life - MERN Style

A project to get me warmed up making simple games with React.js, and an excuse to use my MERN Starter Seed app. This is Conway's Game of Life implemented in React Node and Express.

### Create your config file (see src/config.example.js), then just add water
> ```npm install```

##### Compile code and start server in production
> ```npm start``` 

##### ...or run server for development with hot reload enabled
> ```npm run start:dev``` 

##### Run all tests
> ```npm test```

##### ...or watch your tests as you write code
> ```npm watch```
